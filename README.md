To solve this, i gathered the informations given and filtered everything, and with that leading to the report of people that saw the crime, i searched for where they lived, then their id, so i could see their interview with the police. After that, i simply filtered all of the info (using a JOIN, obviously) so i could finnaly know who he should be (details about his membership on a gym, a part of his cars plate number, etc.). I was surprised to know that discovering the assasin was not the end! So, i continued coding to discover who could be behind of everything! i searched for the interview of the assassin to gather more info about the true villain, and then filtered the facebook_event_checkin, drivers_license and person table (using a join) with the conditions of being a woman of 65 to 67 height, red hair, drives a tesla model s and attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017 to discover she was 'Miranda Priestly'. 

It was a great test to me! I absolutely loved it! I already liked to play mystery games so its wonderful to join work and passion in such a way! Thank you very much! 

I also loved the funny crime scene reports on the table! after i finished the challenge i read every one of them! i especially liked those with bits of alice in wonderland!
